        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Vishal, a lifelong learner, avid rock climber, community volunteer.

I am deeply passionate about learning. Whether it's professional skills or personal interests, my constant curiosity drives me to understand more about the world around me. This passion shapes my life's journey, fueling my desire for growth and development.

Outside the realm of formal learning, I am drawn to the exhilarating challenge of rock climbing. This adrenaline-filled adventure embodies my approach to life - pushing boundaries, overcoming obstacles, and reaching new heights. But rock climbing isn't just a personal pursuit; it's also a means of bringing joy to others.

As part of Rock Cancer, I have the privilege of sharing this incredible sport with pediatric patients who have battled cancer or other debilitating illnesses. Our organization provides free rock climbing experiences, helping these resilient young people discover their strength, ignite their spirit, and enjoy moments of sheer joy and achievement. It's an endeavor that fills me with profound pride and satisfaction.

When I'm not scaling rock faces or encouraging others to do the same, I volunteer at Saint Andrew's Breakfast Program, an organization committed to providing essential services to the unhoused population of Ann Arbor. This volunteering experience humbles me, deepening my understanding of empathy and gratitude, and reminding me of the importance of giving back to the community.

In my downtime, there's nothing I cherish more than the company of my friends. The shared laughter, learning experiences, and the support we provide one another are invaluable. They make life's journey rich and meaningful.</p>
