Rock Cancer offers free rock climbing sessions to young patients aged 4–25 battling cancer or with a history of cancer, along with other chronic medical conditions. Hosted every third Friday at Planet Rock Ann Arbor, this program empowers participants to reclaim their strength, enhance their range of motion, and rebuild confidence post-treatment.

Beyond climbing, Rock Cancer serves as a beacon of hope and resilience, celebrating the unstoppable spirit of its young climbers.

**Free Rock Climbing, Community Support, and Ice Cream!** The perfect trio! 🧗‍♀️🍦❤️

At Rock Cancer, I proudly serve on the leadership team, where I help with our digital presence and orchestrating fundraising initiatives.

Beyond my strategic contributions, I also volunteer as a belayer—directly supporting the transformational journeys of young climbers. I've witnessed their incredible progress and resilience as they conquer the rock wall.

Rock Cancer is more than a program—it's a **community**. From climbers rediscovering their strength to supporters who sustain our mission, we're united by the belief that:

> Every challenge, no matter how steep, can be overcome with determination and support.
